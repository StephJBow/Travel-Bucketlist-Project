<h1 align="center">My Travel BucketList</h1> 

## Description
A web database for users to store details of countries and cities visited, and those they wish to visit.
My second solo project, this website was built using Python, Flask and PostgreSQL, and using HTML and CSS were used for frontend styling.

The project was completed over one week and concluded with a public presentation. As a keen traveller, I was excited to explore the possibility of creating a website or app that I myself would use.

This project makes use of Object-Oriented Programming with Python, Test Driven Development, Web Programming (REST, MVC), and interacts with a PostgreSQL database with CRUD principles, and SQLAlchemy.

Here's a quick video walk-through of the website
